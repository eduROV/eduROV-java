# eduROV-java
This is a reboot of the eduROV project in 2024, with the aim of simplifying and updating the code to be more approachable by a beginner. Also, for Kristoffer to create his own codebase and fully understand the moving pieces of a remotely controlled robot using a Rapsberry Pi and Arduino. The project will be published on www.edurov.com.
